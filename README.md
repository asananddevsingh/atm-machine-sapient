ATM Money Dispenser
 
Screen Details:
The screen above shows the distinct elements needed as part of the user interface. The left pane contains an input box and the “Get Money” button – apart from the heading. The content for the right pane is dynamically generated – basis of the computed values.

Core Functionality (work flow)
User enters the amount(whole numbers only) needed in the text field. On clicking on “Get Money” – the app computes the least number of notes needed to get to the exact amount (which the ATM would dispense). The possible denominations are of Rs. 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 2000.  The computed count gets displayed on the right panel – as shown in the image above.
